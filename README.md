## Installation

Start by installing [pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv/blob/master/INSTALLING.md) on your system.

```
bundle install
```

## Testing

This library includes a set of automated tests that exercise all functionality.

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Example

We are using `/dev/shm` to
[emulate persistent memory](http://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html)
in this simple example.

```ruby
require 'pmemkv/all'

def assert(condition)
  raise RuntimeError.new('Assert failed') unless condition
end

puts 'Starting engine'
db = DataBase.new('vsmap', '{"path":"/dev/shm/"}')

puts 'Putting new key'
db.put('key1', 'value1')
assert db.count == 1

puts 'Reading key back'
assert db.get('key1').eql?('value1')

puts 'Iterating existing keys'
db.put('key2', 'value2')
db.put('key3', 'value3')
db.all_strings {|k| puts "  visited: #{k}"}

puts 'Removing existing key'
db.remove('key1')
assert !db.exists('key1')

puts 'Stopping engine'
db.stop
```
