	* Version 0.8

	This is the first official release of pmemkv-ruby project.

        It provides Ruby bindings to libpmemkv 0.8 with simplified API and not
        functionally equal to its native C/C++ counterpart.

        The reason this release has version 0.8 is because its current API
        requires extensions with idiomatic approach.
